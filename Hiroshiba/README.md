#### mitsuba

This directory contains the source codes that can make 3D human body images by using [Mitsuba](http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/).  
When we run *body_test2.py*, we can get "body movement movie".

#### NeuralNetwork

This directory contains the source codes that can train and test to "mirror self-recognition".  
When we run *test_LastML.py*, a model will be trained and tested.
